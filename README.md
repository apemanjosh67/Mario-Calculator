# Super Mario Bros. Calculator
A Super Mario-style Android app calculator.<br><br>
Mario games were a large part of my childhood, so I thought nothing would be cooler than to have a Mario-themed calculator on my phone. Each button on the calculator is based on a sprite from the iconic 1985 release, Super Mario Bros, it uses the Mario-style font, and the user can toggle the Mario theme song in the background.<br><br>
The code for the app was written in Kotlin, and was made using JetBrain's Android Studio IDE. In terms of functionality, the calculator can perform floating-point addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, with support for parentheses and order-of-operations. It can also calculate exponents, primary trigonometric functions, and the natural logarithm. As such, the calculator can be used to compute any elementary mathematical operation or function.<br><br>

Here is a video showcasing the app in action:<br>
